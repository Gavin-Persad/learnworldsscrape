## React Basics 🏃🏼‍♂️

React Basics 🏃🏼‍♂️
At the moment all you know is: React is a popular library you can use to build User Interfaces and that React makes it easier to do things like listen to events, get data and update the DOM.
There is no better place to learn the next level of detail about React than their official documentation. We've curated a paired down list of short articles from those docs. Please read each article, take notes and complete the challenges at the bottom of each to test your knowledge. If you struggle then use ChatGPT to give you a different explanation of an article - you could ask it:
"Hey I'm trying to learn about React and I'm struggling to understand this article about props - https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component. Could you please explain it to me as if I'm a 10 year old?"
^^ 🙂😂 This works - we've tried it many time!
Just remember - there are lots of new ideas but this is just Javascript, and "components" are just functions that return a React Element that will be rendered as HTML. It will take a while for all of this to settle in and become normal but we have time.
Now, time to get started. Please complete the following:
Describing the UI (quick overview of main react topics):
https://react.dev/learn/describing-the-ui
Your First Component:
https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component
Writing Mark-up with JSX:
https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx
Passing Props to Components:
https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component
Here's a rough overview of what you should have learned from the articles above:
You understand some of the key benefits of React and why it became popular.
You should understand how to create simple components in React.
How JSX allows you to write HTML-like code directly within your JavaScript files.
Props are like parameters you can give to components to customise their behavior or appearance.
Here's a short video explaining the basic history of React, why it's risen in popularity for Frontend developers, a simple overview of how components are used and explanation of how React pages display their elements.
